## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of investment performance using Excel. The analysis covers a range of metrics including returns, risk-adjusted performance, standard deviation, beta, alpha, variance, and covariance. These insights are crucial for strategic financial planning and investment decision-making.

## Objective
- Beta Calculation: Utilized Beta to evaluate each stock's exposure to systematic risk, providing valuable insights into their relative riskiness within the market.
- Alpha Quantification: Employed Alpha metrics to assess investment returns over the market return, considering both systematic and unsystematic risk factors.

## Data Source
The dataset used for analysis was sourced from Yahoo Finance, covering daily returns for various technology stocks (Facebook, Apple, Google, and Microsoft) throughout the year 2019.

## Features
**1. Portfolio Construction:** Assembled a diversified portfolio of the aforementioned technology stocks, allocating 25% of the investment to each.

**2. Risk Evaluation:**
- Calculated Standard Deviation to measure the volatility of returns, a crucial indicator of investment risk.
- Computed the Sharpe Ratio, which offers insights into the risk-adjusted performance of the portfolio.

**3. Statistical Insights:**
- Explored the significance of Variance and Covariance in understanding risk exposure and diversification benefits.

**4. Beta Assessment:**
- Evaluated the Beta of individual stocks and the portfolio, shedding light on their sensitivity to market movements.

**5. Alpha Analysis:**
- Calculated Alpha for each stock and the overall portfolio, providing a measure of their performance against the market return.

## Results
**1. Performance Metrics Table:**

A detailed table provides key performance metrics for five different assets (FB, AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, and the S&P500) along with the portfolio. Here are some notable observations:

- Returns: Daily returns vary, with AAPL showing the highest return (0.27%) and the S&P500 the lowest (0.10%).
- Risk-Adjusted Performance: AAPL exhibits the highest Sharpe Ratio (3.47), indicating superior returns per unit of risk.
- Standard Deviation: FB displays the highest volatility (1.75%), signifying increased risk.
- Beta: All assets and the portfolio have Betas greater than 1, suggesting higher volatility compared to the market.
- Alpha: AAPL demonstrates the highest Alpha (50.64%), surpassing expected returns given its risk level.
- Variance and Covariance: These metrics help evaluate the relationship between asset returns and the market.

**2. Daily Return Percentage Table:**

This table provides daily return percentages for a portfolio of stocks over the year 2019. Notable observations include:
- Daily returns exhibit fluctuations, both positive and negative.
- Significant changes occurred on specific dates, e.g., a drop on 2019-06-03 (-4.43%) and a spike on 2019-08-08 (2.55%).
- Consecutive positive and negative returns indicate periods of upward and downward trends.

## Analysis Highlights
**1. Risk Assessment and Portfolio Construction:** The project initiated with the assembly of a diversified portfolio, strategically allocating 25% of the investment to each of the selected technology stocks. This step laid the foundation for the subsequent evaluation of risk and performance metrics.

**2. Beta and Systematic Risk Exposure:** The assessment of Beta for individual stocks and the portfolio provided valuable insights into their sensitivity to market movements. All assets, as well as the portfolio itself, exhibited Betas greater than 1, indicating a generally higher level of volatility compared to the broader market.

**3. Alpha and Excess Returns:** The calculation of Alpha for each stock and the overall portfolio shed light on their performance relative to the market return. AAPL, in particular, demonstrated a notable Alpha of 50.64%, surpassing expected returns given its level of risk. This suggests that the investment in AAPL provided a higher return adjusted for risk compared to the market.

**4. Risk-Adjusted Performance Metrics:** The performance metrics table offered a comprehensive overview of the risk-adjusted characteristics of selected assets and the portfolio. Noteworthy observations include the varying levels of returns and volatility among assets, with AAPL standing out for its superior risk-adjusted performance, as evidenced by its high Sharpe Ratio.

**5. Variance, Covariance, and Relationship with the Market:** The significance of Variance and Covariance was explored in the context of understanding risk exposure and diversification benefits. These metrics provided insights into how individual assets' returns related to the broader market.

**6. Daily Return Trends and Market Dynamics:** The daily return percentage table highlighted the dynamic nature of the portfolio's performance throughout the year 2019. Observations included notable fluctuations, both positive and negative, along with distinct changes on specific dates. The presence of consecutive positive and negative returns indicated periods of upward and downward trends in the portfolio's performance.
## Conclusion
In the realm of investment, understanding and evaluating performance metrics is paramount for making informed financial decisions. Through this project, we have delved into the intricacies of returns, risk-adjusted performance, standard deviation, beta, alpha, variance, and covariance.

By dissecting these metrics, we have gained valuable insights into the performance and risk profiles of selected assets and our portfolio. These insights serve as a compass for strategic financial planning, enabling us to navigate the complex landscape of investment with greater confidence.

As we conclude this analysis, it is evident that a data-driven approach to investment analysis equips us with the tools necessary for informed decision-making. This project serves as a testament to the power of data in shaping financial strategies and underscores the importance of leveraging quantitative insights in the pursuit of financial success.
